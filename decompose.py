"""Decompose an arbitrary unitary into the universal basis {H, T, CNOT}.

A unitary is
lowered in stages:

    1. twolevel_decomposition:  Unitary     -> list[TwoLevel]
    2. decompose_twolevel:      TwoLevel    -> SingleQubitGate + ControlledU
    3. decompose_controlledU:   ControlledU -> CU + CNOT
    4. decompose_cu:            CU          -> SingleQubitGate + CNOT
    5. decompose_to_ht:         SingleQubitGate -> H / T words (using rotation.py)

Numpy types: a `Unitary` (N x N) and a 2x2 gate block are
both np.ndarray (complex128); a `ComplexVec` is a 1-D np.ndarray. A `Circuit` is a
Python list of gate objects, each exposing `to_unitary()`; gates are stored in
order of application (the first gate is applied first, i.e. the rightmost matrix
factor).

Every function/method below is a stub for you to implement; See "03 - Completing the Decomposition.pdf" for the recommended order.
